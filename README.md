# Task Manager App

## Description
Developed a **Task Manager** application that allows users to efficiently manage their tasks. The app includes functionality for creating, updating, and deleting tasks. Tasks can be categorized into four states:

- **Upcoming**: Tasks that are scheduled for a future date.
- **Overdue**: Tasks that are past their due date.
- **Completed**: Tasks that have been finished.

The app uses **local storage** to persist task data, ensuring that the user's data is saved even when the page is refreshed or the browser is closed. The key features of the app include:

- **Task Creation**: Add new tasks with titles, descriptions, and due dates.
- **Task Update**: Edit task details, including title, description, due date, and status.
- **Task Deletion**: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Task Categorization**: Automatically sort tasks into categories based on their Priority (High, Medium, Low).
- **Local Storage Integration**: Ensures data persistence across sessions using browserâ€™s local storage.

## Tech Stack Used
- **React.js**
- **JavaScript**: For the logic behind adding, updating, and deleting tasks, as well as interacting with local storage.
- **Local Storage**: For storing task data locally on the browser.
